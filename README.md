# Torgue-Calculator
A simple python program to calculate the torgue of a 3 Link Robot  Arm (Usually 6 DOF).I used tkinter to create a User Friendly GUI.

I also converted the python file into an executable file (exe) if you want to download it straight without viewing the code or having python installed at all.
